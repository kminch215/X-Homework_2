# X-Homework_2

The assignment is to create a Java program for managing student information. There are two classes that are implemented: `Student` and `StudentManager`. 

**Student Class**: 
   - A class with private fields for student attributes: id, name, and grade.
   - Has two constructors (default and parameterized), getter/setter methods, a toString() method, and an equals() method to display student information.

  **StudentManager Class**: 
   - A class to handle main logic.
   - Uses an array to store student objects.
   - Implements methods to read student data from a file, display student details, search for students by ID, and update student grades.

### How to run:
1. First make sure to have a way to compile and run Java files. It also might help to have an IDE like Eclipse to run the code.
2. Implement a syntactically and logically correct program to put in the main() method  in the Main Class. This method is going to be accessing the `StudentManager` and `Student` Classes and calling the different functions to manage student information.
3. After saving the Main Class file, then run the code using your desired method. For this assignment we used the Run feature in the Eclipse IDE
